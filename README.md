# HAMILTONIAN-TSP
This repository contains code relating to my research on the Hamiltonian path, travelling salesman, and similar problems. 
It contains functions for generating and visualizing weighted graphs, finding Hamiltonian paths in those graphs, and comparing different
heuristics and algorithms on measures such as factor of optimality and time-complexity.

The programs in this repository are free and open software. You may replicate and use them however you like provided said usage complies
with the terms of the GNU GLPv3 license (see LICENSE.md for details).
