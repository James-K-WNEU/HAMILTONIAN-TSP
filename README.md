# HAMILTONIAN-TSP
This repository contains code relating to my research on the Hamiltonian path, travelling salesman, and similar problems. 
It contains functions for generating weighted graphs, finding Hamiltonian paths in those graphs, and comparing different
heuristics and algorithms on measures such as factor of optimality and time-complexity.
